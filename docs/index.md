# Bioinformatics Tools Documentation

[Skip to quickstart](tutorial/start.md)

**Purpose**: make everyday bioinformatics easier by supercharging the tools
available for researchers to use on the command line.

This is a general command-line tool that has a diverse set of functionality all aiming
to make bioinformatics easier and better. We accomplish this by creating small programs
the user can invoke on the command line to analyze their data. We take care of the following
aspects:

1. Programs that analyze and manipulate specific files
2. Programs that allow you to create your own database
3. Programs that run through a complete workflow on your file(s)/database(s)
4. Programs that will package up a complete project for easy archiving and sharing

**What We Solve**:

1. Quick file manipulations and analyses
2. Automating redundant tasks
3. Reducing file count and need for file organization by using 1 transferrable database per file/sample
4. Comprehensive log messages for easier troubleshooting
